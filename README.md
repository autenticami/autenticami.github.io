# Autenticami

`Autenticami` is a multi-account `Identity and Access Managment` (IAM or IdAM) solution to enable a modern identity-based application access control.

Autenticami is inspired by AWS Identity and Access Managment (IAM) therefore Policies are implemented using an AWS-like definition language.

`Autenticami` allows to specify who or what can access resources by the means of fine-grained permissions.

- `Who`: *Identities (Users and Roles) that can authenticate*
- `Can Access`: *Permissions with policies to ensure appropriate access to resources for identities*
- `Resources`: *Custom resources linked to the account*
