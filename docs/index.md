# Autenticami

`Autenticami` is a Multi-Account `Identity and Access Managment` provider which implements OAuth and OpenId protocols.

An `Account` is identified by an `Account Id` and it is responsible for defining `Users, Roles and Permissions`, as well as configuring the `Authentication Process`.

!!! info "INFO" 
    `Autenticami` is inspired by AWS IAM and Policies are defined using an `AWS like definition languange`.

An `Authenticated Identity` is issued with an `Access Token` that can be used by third-party APIs to grant access to its resources.
