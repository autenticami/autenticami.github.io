# Autenticami

`Autenticami` is a multi-account `Identity and Access Managment` (IAM or IdAM) platform that provides the foundations for creating an identity-based application access control.

!!! info "INFO"
    `Autenticami` is inspired by AWS IAM and Policies are implemented using an `AWS like definition languange`.

By the means of `Autenticami` it is possibile to specify who or what can access resources by the means of fine-grained permissions.

- `Who`: *Users and Roles that can authenticate*
- `Can Access`: *Permission with policies to ensure appropriate access to resources for identities*
- `Resources`: *Custom resources defined into the account*
