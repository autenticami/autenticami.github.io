# Identity and Access Managment

An `Identity and Access Managment` (IAM or IdAM) is a framework of policies and technologies to ensure that the right users and roles have the appropriate access to resources.

With `Autenticami` you can specify who or what can access resources by the means of fine-grained permissions.

- `Who`: *Users and Roles that can authenticate*
- `Can Access`: *Permission with policies to ensure appropriate access to resources for users and roles*
- `Resources`: *Custom resourced defined by the tenant*
