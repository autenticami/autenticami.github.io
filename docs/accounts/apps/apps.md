# Apps and Resources

Autenticami doesn't actually own the resources but it is a solution to enable a modern identity-based application access control for third party applications.

## Apps

An app represents a third party application that contains resources. Multiple applications can share the same resources.
For each application, you can specify a collection of tags.

## Domains

An application is divided into domains, using a DDD approach.


## Resources

A resource represents a resource from a third-party application that are organised into domains.
For each resource, you can specify a collection of actions and tags.
