# Apps and Resources

Autenticami doesn't acutally own the resources but it is a solution to enable a modern identity-based application access control for applications.

An app developer sets up the account to map apps and resources, and finally implements access management policies and permissions.

## Apps

An app represents a virtual application that contains resources. Multiple applications can share the same resources.

##Â Resources

A resource is a virtual resource that has policies associated with it.
For each resource, you can specify a collection of actions and tags.
