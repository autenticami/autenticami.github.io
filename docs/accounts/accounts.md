# Accounts

An Account is identified by an `account number` and it is responsible for `Identities` (Users, Groups, Roles), `Projects`, `Domains`, `Resources`, `Policies and Permissions for Access Management`.

Autentication can be implemented by using any `third party Identity Provider` such as Auth0, Okta, Google, Facebook, etc.

Those external managed identities has to be mapped to the internal `Identities` (Users, Groups, Roles) in the system.
