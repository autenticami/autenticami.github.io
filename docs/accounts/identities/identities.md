# Identities

An `Identity Security` is a solution for securing all identities used in an account.

There are mainly two types of identities:

- [User and Groups](../users-groups)
- [Roles](../roles)

Using the `Token Service` it is possible to `swap` a third party token with an `autenticami` token.

## Principals

A `Principal` is an human user or workload with granted permissions that authenticates and make requests, specifically:

- A user
- A role
- An assumed role (role assumed by a user or a role assumed by a workload).
