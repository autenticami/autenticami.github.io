# Identity

An `Identity Security` is a solution for securing all identities used in an account.

There are several types of identities:

- [User and Groups](users-groups)
- [Roles](roles)

Autenticami implements `OAuth` and `OpenId` protocols, in particular an `Authenticated Identity` is issued with an `Access Token` that can be used by third-party Applications and APIs to grant access to its resources.
