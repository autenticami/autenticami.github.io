# Users and Groups

`Users` and `Groups` are identities within an Autenticami account.

## Users

A `User` is an identity representing a single person or application that has specific permissions.

Both temporary and permanent credentials can be granted to a user.


## Group

A `Group` is a collection of users with associated permissions. It is not possible to authenticate with a group, however the permissions associated with the group are inherited by all users who are members of the group.
