# Actions

Actions are operations that can affect more than one resource in the context of one or more features.

Actions must be uniquely identified and they look like `people:CreateTimesheet`.

An `Action` is composed by two sections `{resource}:{action-name}`:

- **Resource**: Terget resource of the action
- **ActionName**: Name of the action.
