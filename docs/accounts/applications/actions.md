# Actions

Actions are operations that can affect more than one resource in the context of one or more features.

Actions must be uniquely identified and they look like `people:CreateTimesheet`.

An `Action` is composed by two sections (`{domain}:{action-name}`):

- **Domain**: Domain in which the action can be used
- **ActionName**: Name of the action.
